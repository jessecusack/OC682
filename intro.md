# Introduction

This site collects the lecture notes for _OC682 Data Analysis in the Time and Space Domains_, a graduate level course taught within the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State University. The course is aimed at students across the branches of geoscience and engineering. 

These notes were developed from course materials first created by Prof. Dudley Chelton. Later instructors Prof. Jim Lerzcak and Prof. Melanie Fewings revised the lecture material, forming the basis for the current iteration of the class circa 2024. I converted parts of the material into this Jupyter Book and added a large number class assignments using Jupyter Notebooks.
